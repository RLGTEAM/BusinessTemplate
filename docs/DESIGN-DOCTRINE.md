# Design doctrine — constrain quality, never form

The template ships a **floor** (mechanical, testable rules) and a **toolkit**
(tokens, primitives, animation system, content pipeline, reference sections).
You — the model building a client site — design the page 0→100 on top of them.
Nothing structural is prescribed; everything structural is available. The test
gate, not a list of allowed layouts, decides what ships.

## The floor (non-negotiable, unchanged)

- RTL: logical properties/utilities only; `--dir-factor` / `--angle-brand` /
  `--origin-inline-start` / `--bg-pos-inline-start` for what doesn't auto-flip;
  `<bdi>` for mixed runs; `.force-ltr` for phones/prices/emails; no
  letter-spacing on Hebrew.
- Copy lives in `business.json`, read via `getBusiness()` — never hardcoded.
  Images via `resolveImage()`; hrefs via `resolveHref()`.
- Colors are tokens (`--color-primary|secondary|accent|surface|…`); tints via
  `color-mix()`. Text sits only on validated contrast pairs, computed against
  the REAL palette values (9 pairs built into `scripts/validate-content.ts`:
  ink/ink-muted × surface/surface-alt, primary/secondary × surface/surface-alt,
  accent↔secondary) — `text-primary` on `bg-surface`; on dark surfaces use
  `text-surface`. New color-as-text pair → add it to
  `scripts/validate-content.ts` first.
- Reduced motion = static page. Design the still frame first. All motion lives
  inside the matchMedia context in `src/lib/animation/index.ts`; entrances via
  `data-reveal`; animate transforms/opacity only.
- Decorative elements: `aria-hidden="true"` + `pointer-events-none`.
- No new dependencies. TypeScript strict, no `any`, Zod at runtime boundaries.
- The gate: `npm run test` + `npm run test:e2e` + `npm run test:ltr-build`
  green; Lighthouse budgets hold (LCP ≤ 2.5s, TBT ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1).

## The page contract (what every site must keep)

- Exactly one `h1`.
- Every `content.nav` link of the form `#id` resolves to a real element id;
  sections use `<section id="…">` + `scroll-mt-20` + the `section-pad` utility.
- A `body > footer` containing links to the two legal pages
  (accessibility statement is a legal requirement in Israel, ת"י 5568).
- The frozen `content` core stays intact: `nav`, `ui`, `consent`, `notFound`,
  `legal`. Hebrew sites keep a bidi test line (Hebrew + Latin + ₪) in visible
  body copy.
- A clear contact path (form, WhatsApp, or phone) reachable from the nav.
- Several per-client `content` fields are load-bearing for the SEO/AEO
  machine: `content.services.title` (LocalBusiness OfferCatalog name in
  `lib/jsonld.ts`) and `content.faq.items` (read by BOTH `faqJsonLd` and
  the `llms.txt` endpoint). The typecheck gate flags any you remove — keep
  them with real content, or adapt every reader (and the smoke JSON-LD
  count) in the same commit.
- The contract-driven smoke suite passes with ZERO edits. New user-visible
  behavior gets **added** tests in the client repo; never weaken the suite.

## Divergence (hard rules)

A site that passes the floor and the page contract can still be the
reference template with different words on it. These five are binding for
every client build (enforced at the concept stage in `/new-client` Step 1):

1. A bespoke hero treatment — not a stock `Hero` variant left untouched.
2. At least one fully bespoke section.
3. A signature motion implemented in `registerCustomAnimations()`
   (`src/lib/animation/custom.ts`).
4. A non-default color story — no all-default-white page unless
   `docs/concept.md` explicitly argues light-minimal serves THIS client.
5. A composition order different from the reference default.

The design-review skill (`.claude/skills/design-review/SKILL.md`) is the
single source for how the built result is judged against these rules and the
rest of the rubric — this doc doesn't restate the scoring. A site that fails
that review isn't finished, even with a green test gate.

## The toolkit

- **Tokens** (`global.css`): brand colors from `voice.palette`, neutrals
  included (`surface`, `surfaceAlt`, `ink`, `inkMuted`, `line` — defaults are
  the reference light theme; a dark site is a first-class palette, not a
  hack). Shadows derive from `ink`. Shape/rhythm via `--shape-radius-card`,
  `--shape-radius-button`, `--section-py` — override per client in
  `custom.css`, never literal radii or `py-*`.
- **Fonts**: `design.fontPairing` — fifteen self-hosted Hebrew-capable
  pairings, each with its own weight set (the one design decision that stays
  data; fonts register at build time). `handmade` (Amatic SC) is
  display-only — headings, never body copy, and never long headings.
  Components only use `font-display` / `font-sans`.
- **Reference sections** (`src/components/sections/`): tested, RTL-correct
  worked examples. Use them as-is, pass their variant props
  (`Hero variant`, `Services layout`, `Gallery layout`), gut and redesign
  them, or ignore them and build fresh — per client, per section. They are
  examples of the rules, not the product.
- **Composition**: `src/pages/index.astro` is yours. The shipped default
  composes the references so a fresh clone builds green.
- **UI primitives**: `Container`, `SectionHeading`, `Button`.
- **Animation**: `data-reveal` presets for entrances (`slide-start`,
  `slide-end`, `scale`, `blur`, `clip`), each tunable per-element via
  `data-reveal-duration` / `-delay` / `-distance` / `-start` (and `-stagger`
  on `data-reveal-group`). `blur` (animates `filter`) and `clip` (animates
  `clipPath`, dir-aware) are the TWO sanctioned exceptions to
  transforms/opacity-only — everything else stays on transforms/opacity.
  Bespoke GSAP/ScrollTrigger goes in `registerCustomAnimations()` in
  `src/lib/animation/custom.ts` — the entry point, called inside the
  reduced-motion-guarded matchMedia context (tweens created synchronously
  revert on swap; return cleanup only for listeners/observers you own). Lenis
  + ScrollTrigger are pre-synced; importing gsap adds ~0 bytes.
- **Schema**: `data` + `voice` are frozen. The per-client region of `content`
  is reshaped schema-first: `business.schema.ts` → `business.json` →
  components via `getBusiness()`.

## The design process (before any code)

Write the concept in four lines — if you can't, it isn't one concept yet:

1. **Metaphor** — one thing from the client's world their customers instantly
   recognize (vinyl / steam / thread / clipper lines).
2. **Color story** — which sections go light / tinted / dark; where the accent
   burns brightest (usually the CTA). Rhythm, not stripes.
3. **Composition** — the actual page: which sections exist, what each one *is*,
   in what order, and why that order serves this business.
4. **Motion identity** — the ONE characteristic movement reused everywhere
   motion appears, including the `data-reveal` choices.

Plus the reduced-motion still frame: the page must look complete without any
motion. ONE concept, expressed everywhere it helps — incoherence, not
quantity, is what reads as noise.

## The promote loop

When a client-repo idea proves broadly useful, generalize it (tokens, props,
`data-reveal` preset, or a new reference section) and PR it into the template.
Client repos stay free to be weird; the template absorbs only the winners.
Never copy client-specific code between client repos.
